# Project Context

Keep this doc short and current. It exists to help contributors and agents quickly understand the project.

## What This Project Is

- Product: BusinessOS conversion website.
- Audience: SMB founders and commercial teams.
- Primary goals: Drive demo bookings and capture niche-specific organic demand.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Vite, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui.
- Routing: `react-router-dom`.
- Booking integration: `@calcom/embed-react` (namespace `meet-demo-businessos`).
- Content architecture: file-based content under `content/blog` and `content/landings`.
- Backend/services: no backend in this repo (frontend-only MVP).
- Hosting/deploy: static hosting (Vercel-compatible).

## Key Flows

- Demo flow:
  1. User clicks demo CTA.
  2. App routes to `/agendar-demo`.
  3. Cal inline widget handles booking.
  4. If no slots, WhatsApp fallback link is shown.
  5. On `bookingSuccessfulV2`, app redirects to `/agenda-confirmada`.

- Blog flow:
  1. User opens `/blog`.
  2. Index is generated from `content/blog/*.mdx`.
  3. User opens `/blog/:slug` with full SEO metadata and `BlogPosting` JSON-LD.

- SEO landing flow:
  1. User arrives on dynamic route `/:landingSlug`.
  2. Landing renders from `content/landings/*.json` using a reusable conversion layout.
  3. User clicks WhatsApp CTA (hero/header/floating button).
  4. Optional analytics event `cta_whatsapp_click` is fired when tracking exists.

## Architecture Notes

- Main landing sections are composed in `src/pages/Index.tsx`.
- Blog loaders and landing loaders live in `src/lib/content`.
- Reusable landing conversion layout lives in `src/components/landing/LandingLayout.tsx`.
- SEO head management lives in `src/components/SEO.tsx`.
- Build-time SEO assets are generated by `scripts/generate-seo-assets.mjs`.

## Routes

- `/`
- `/agendar-demo`
